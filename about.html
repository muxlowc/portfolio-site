intro-title: "Heyo!"
intro-text: |
  Growing up, I was told by many people that ”if you have half a brain, you must go to University.” So, I went to university. I always loved art and history class in high school, so I went to school for Classics, specializing in ancient art, (because this seemed like a better idea than art school at the time).<br><br>After receiving my degree, I went on to do physical labor by digging in the dirt for 10 months of the year (aka. archaeology). After a couple of years, I realized that this wasn’t what I was meant to be doing. I did, however, realize that I loved working with my hands, and that I missed creating things.<br><br>Back to school I went. And this time, I knew. This is where I should be. This is what I should be doing. No longer am I digging up someone else’s creations. I am digging within myself to discover new ways of creating something for myself.
