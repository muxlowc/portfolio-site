intro-text: |
  Sharp as Knives began as a means to use our passion of graphic design and illustration and bring it into the world of fashion. Noticing an absence of locally handcrafted, high-quality apparel that is inclusive to all humans, no matter their size or gender, we decided to start a screenprinting business with designs that we ourselves would want to wear. We believe that all humans should feel as comfortable in their own skin as in one of their t-shirts!
  <br><br>
  As a co-founder of Sharp as Knives, I have had the amazing opportunity to learn how a business is run from behind the scenes. Working alongside my partner, we have developed our brand from the ground up, creating a logo, a website, a social media presence, many handmade products, to running booths at various local markets.

  *Sharp as Knives is currently on hiatus, but we will be back Summer 2018!*
