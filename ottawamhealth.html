  <a href="https://www.ottawamhealth.ca/">The Ottawa mHealth Lab</a> is a small research and development team that specializes in creating practical, easy-to-use apps for people to manage their health information. The largest, and most well-known project by the Ottawa mHealth Lab is CANImmunize, a mobile app for tracking your immunization records.<br><br>I helped the team design a new web platform for CANImmunize, which would allow the users of the app to access their records on the web as well as on mobile. Endless amounts of wireframing, subtle branding tweaks, easy-to-use UI & UX, combined with a minimalist  design were all necessary for the project to succeed.<br><br>In addition to the CANImmunize web platform, I also designed a companion website for educational purposes: <a href="https://learn.canimmunize.ca/">check it out here.</a>
