  The Hintonburg Market is a small local grocery store based in the heart of the Hintonburg neighbourhood in Ottawa, Ontario. This passion project allowed me to study the demographic of the neighbourhood in order to design a new brand for the market. Discovering that a large majority of its neighbours are young families, the brand took on a youthful yet natural look. A logo took the shape of a barn made with the letter "H", and fonts chosen are modern, yet rustic. The final product was a detailed branding guideline.
